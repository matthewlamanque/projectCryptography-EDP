# Project Cryptography

## Password Creation and Retrieval

Uses the MERN web stack with a Python (Django) cryptography engine and an ELK logging stack with S3 bucket interface (MinIO) storage. Built and tested using Docker with compose. Designed for cloud deployment, but that will require additional work and configuration.
