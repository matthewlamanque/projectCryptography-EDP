# Project Cryptography

## Encryption and Decryption

Uses the MEAN web stack with a Python (Django) cryptography API and an ELK logging stack with a S3 bucket interface (using MinIO) storage. Built and tested using Docker with compose. Designed for cloud deployment, but that will require additional work and configuration.
